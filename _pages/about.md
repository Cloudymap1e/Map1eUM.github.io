Welcome to visit this website!

I am currently a Computer Science student at UBC in third year. My primary interests lie in Machine learning/Computer Vision. I am also interested in web development and automation. And I am curious and willing to learn and work in new areas.

I also have a strong fundamental background in Mathematics and Physics, and am interested in Algorithms design and analysis and proof theory thanks to my intense training and interests in these areas.

Currently, my new primary ongoing project is to create an algorithmic trading platform that can also incorporated automatically fetched news and fundamentals.

I am looking for a co-op position in 2024 fall.
