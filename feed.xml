I’m excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you. Stay tuned for more updates and interesting content.</p> <p>This post is written on Thanksgiving Day, that marked my almost ending of my first half of final academic year life… I decided to move out of that shitty basement and it’s such a good decision that makes me have much more time and energy to focus on my important things.</p> <p>I am working on Microlight project, a system that makes AI have the highest level of intelligence and execute on behalf of humans for many tasks. This project will have a lot of phases considering my current knowledge level and it’s a long way to go. I will first implement most basic functions and resource-related programs first, including the automation ofCAPTCHA, emails, phone, payment verifications and many things like this. I will just do these tedious work little by little.</p> <p>In the meanwhile, I will keep trying my best in investing in the US equity market and other financial instruments. I realized that my career is kind of dead and maybe the investment and quant trading can be my next direction. I will try my best to explore the road for me.</p> <p>I haven’t written posts for a long time. I stopped doing this when I decided to use 24-hour streaming with auto recording by YouTube to replace the daily note and reflection, because I believe soon I will just use AI to generate a summary based on my everyday complete recordings about what I have done. This is truly interesting. (while I am typing this post my stream is still on!)</p> <p>The finals are coming, dates are set. I am not really stressed about this term, because unlike previous academic years I have keep the pace most of the time and will just be fine to get above avg grades, but I may not be able to achieve a excellent grade I anticipated. The dates are:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/finals.png" width="100%" alt="Finals Dates"/></p> <p>Deep inside I may be disappointed by my current life. I am not sure if I can make it. But whining is truly useless, either kill yourself or make it alive.</p> <p>In the future I may write more posts - dated or topic, with more thinking, some deep insights and some inspirations and so on. Just using streaming video to passively record the life is not good enough, at least in the aspect of improving my productivity.</p> <p>And happy thanksgiving! although my current state of like is really a irony to this holiday. Tonight when I am at X050 lab there is a short guy keeps talking(annoying!) and there is a pretty girl sitting next to him. I haven’t been excited about any girl for a long time, but this girl is really pretty and I can’t help but look at her, and think about my relationship status, like a dessert.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="general"/><category term="introduction"/><category term="first-post"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my first post on this blog.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://map1eum.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://map1eum.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://map1eum.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
