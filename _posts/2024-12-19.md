CPSC 421 I did some T/F questions wrong, but all other questions should be solved perfectly except the 5pt question ask you if pspace belongs to EXPTIME. I did answer it correctly but some steps may be not perfect. Anyway I expect it to reach 80+

CPSC 418 counting problems make me sick, but still I should get avg grade without too much trouble.

FREN 101 makes me kinda sad but I should be fine. Especially recently the grades for last participation and project are not bad.

FRST 303 has no doubt. Should be around 80 if there are no issues.
