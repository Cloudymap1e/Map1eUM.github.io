Welcome to my first post on this blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you. Stay tuned for more updates and interesting content.

This post is written on Thanksgiving Day, that marked my almost ending of my first half of final academic year life... I decided to move out of that shitty basement and it's such a good decision that makes me have much more time and energy to focus on my important things.

I am working on Microlight project, a system that makes AI have the highest level of intelligence and execute on behalf of humans for many tasks. This project will have a lot of phases considering my current knowledge level and it's a long way to go. I will first implement most basic functions and resource-related programs first, including CAPTCHA, emails, phone, payment verifications and many things like this. I will just do these tedious work little by little.

In the meanwhile, I will keep trying my best in investing in the US equity market and other financial instruments. I realized that my career is kind of dead and maybe the investment and quant trading can be my next direction. I will try my best to explore the road for me.

I haven't wrote posts for a long time. I stop ding this when I decided to use 24 hours streaming with auto recording by youtube to replace the dailt note and reflection, because I ibelieve soon I will just use AI to generate a summary based on my everyday complete recordings about what I have done. This is truly interesting. (while I am typing this post my stream is still on!)

The finals are coming, dates are set. I am not really stressed about this term, because unlike previous academic years I have keep the pace most of the time and will just be fine to get above avg grades, but I may not be able to achieve a excellent grade I anticipated. The dates are:

Deep inside I may be disapointed by my current life. I am not sure if I can make it. But whining is truly useless, either kill youself or make it alive.
